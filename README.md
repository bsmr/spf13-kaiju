Kaiju is the next evolution of conversations on the Internet.

Own your comments! Kaiju provides everything you need to quickly build an online community.

Kaiju is a fast powered open source server that provides real time comment
capabilities to any existing webpage via a small (provided) javascript script.

The javascript is written utilizing browserify and socket.io and is contained
in itâ€™s own space so you can feel free to run it on any page without worrying
about conflicts.


# Installation

## Client

### Using the client

A pre-built version of the Kaiju browser-side client is inside this repository at ```ui/build/kaiju-client.js```.

To use it, pull it into your HTML page using a ```<script>``` tag. You can then instantiate the Kaiju client class
using the following code:

```javascript
var kaiju = new Kaiju({
    url: "KAIJU_SERVER_URL",
    forum: "FORUM_ID",
    page: "PAGE_ID",
    selector: "CSS_SELECTOR_FOR_COMMENTS_SECTION"
});

kaiju.connect();
```

The ```connect()``` method will initiate a live connection to the Kaiju server and start listening for arriving comments.

See ```ui/index.html``` for a usage example.

### Building the client

To build the client, the following pre-requisites must be available on the ```PATH```:

* Node v0.8+
* NPM v1.3+
* GNU Make or any compatible make tool

```bash
cd ui
make
```

This will drop the build into ```ui/build/kaiju-client.js```.

## Server

for now, storage of data is done using a MongoDB server, so you should install one.
It should be possibble to support different storage mechanism via some code enhancements. (PR's welcome!)
